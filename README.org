* tab-bar-groups.el

Tab groups for the tab bar.

This package provides the means to work with and to customize the
appearance of named groups of tabs in Emacs 27 and higher (see below for
screenshots and commands).

*Note about tab groups in Emacs 28*: in early 2021, the notion of tab
grouping [[https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/commit/etc/NEWS?id=f9b737fb9d21ac7adff403274167e76e77d033b8][made its way into the upcoming Emacs 28]]. While this package
continues to support a somewhat simplified version of tab grouping in
Emacs 27, it also acknowledges recent developments by realigning its
internals to use (and enhance) the tab bar group related facilities that
Emacs 28 provides. If you are on Emacs 28, make sure to get a recent
nightly.

* Installation

If you use MELPA, an easy way to install this package is via
=package-install=. Alternatively, download =tab-bar-groups.el=, put it
it in your =load-path= and =require= it. Finally, use
=(tab-bar-groups-activate)= or =M-x tab-bar-groups-activate= to turn on
the provided features.

If you use both MELPA and =use-package=, you can use this, too:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package tab-bar-groups
  :ensure
  :config
  (tab-bar-groups-activate))
#+end_src

* Screenshots

Emacs 27, or Emacs 28 without =tab-bar-format-tabs-groups= in
=tab-bar-format=: Showing a bunch of tabs in three groups =Emacs=,
=News=, =tbg=, with =init.el= being the current tab and =Emacs= being
the current group. Note that all tabs of all groups are visible.  Also
note that the =*scratch*= tab (unstyled) is not part of a group.

[[screenshots/tab-bar-groups-emacs-27.png]]

Emacs 28 with =tab-bar-format-tabs-groups= in =tab-bar-format=: Showing
the same groups and tabs as above. Note that
=tab-bar-format-tabs-groups= hides tabs in inactive groups.

[[screenshots/tab-bar-groups-emacs-28.png]]

The faces applied to the current/other tabs and groups are fully
customizable.

* Commands

Table of available commands and their description.

| Command                           | Description                                                                  |
|-----------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| =tab-bar-groups-new-tab=          | Create a new tab in the current group.ยน                                      |
| =tab-bar-groups-duplicate-tab=    | Duplicate current tab in its group.ยน                                        |
| =tab-bar-groups-change-tab-group= | Change the group of the current tab (query name w/ completion).ยน             |
| =tab-bar-groups-rename-group=     | Rename the group that the current tab belongs to (query name w/ completion). |
| =tab-bar-groups-eject-tab=        | Eject the current tab from its group.                                        |
| =tab-bar-groups-close-group-tabs= | Close all tabs of the current group.ยน                                        |
| =tab-bar-groups-regroup-tabs=     | Re-order tabs so that all tabs of each group are next to each other.         |

(1) Required in Emacs 27 only. Emacs 28 provides commands with similar
functionality natively.

* Recommended Keybindings

Note that this package doesn't bind any keys by itself.

In my local configuration, I added bindings for the above commands to
the pre-existing keymap for tab-related commands (=C-x t=):

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package tab-bar-groups
  :ensure
  :demand
  :config
  (tab-bar-groups-activate)
  :bind (:map tab-prefix-map
              ("g0" . tab-bar-groups-close-group-tabs)
              ("g2" . tab-bar-groups-new-tab)
              ("ga" . tab-bar-groups-change-tab-group)
              ("gg" . tab-bar-groups-regroup-tabs)
              ("gd" . tab-bar-groups-duplicate-tab)
              ("gk" . tab-bar-groups-eject-tab)
              ("gr" . tab-bar-groups-rename-group)))
#+end_src

* Building on top of this package
** Extensibility and customizability

This package was built with extensibility in mind. In fact, it's an
extraction of a bigger suite of features that I use locally to enable a
"one tab group per project" workflow.

If you want to change how new tabs pick their appearance/color, how
grouped tabs render in the tab bar or what happens after a tab's group
assignment has changed, have a look at the various extension points of
this package:

- =tab-bar-groups-appearances=
- =tab-bar-groups-colors=
- =tab-bar-groups-pick-group-appearance-function=
- =tab-bar-groups-style-tab-name-functions=
- =tab-bar-groups-tab-post-change-group-functions= (an [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Hooks.html][abnormal hook]])

For example, to keep all tabs of each group next to each other at all
times:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'tab-bar-groups-tab-post-change-group-functions #'tab-bar-groups-regroup-tabs)
#+end_src

** Helper functions to roll your own tools

This package provides a range of helper functions that you can use to
find out about existing groups, their names, etc.

For an example of their use, have a look at the two functions provided
below. I use these locally as wrappers around =project-switch-project=
and =project-kill-buffers= to enable the "one tab group per project"
workflow I mentioned above.

In a gist, =switch-project= ...

- queries the user for a project from the list of known projects,
- derives the tab group name from either a [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Directory-Local-Variables.html][dir-local variable]] named
  =tab-bar-group-name= or the project's directory name,
- finds the tab group with that name and switches to its first tab, or,
  if no such tab group exists,
- creates a new tab group with that name and calls
  =project-switch-project= to open it.

=close-project= runs =project-kill-buffers=, then closes all tabs in the
project's tab group.

#+begin_src lisp
(defun switch-project (project-dir)
  "Switch to project in PROJECT-DIR."
  (interactive (list (project-prompt-project-dir)))
  (let ((tab-bar-group-name
             (or (with-temp-buffer
                   (setq default-directory project-dir)
                   (hack-dir-local-variables-non-file-buffer)
                   (and (boundp 'tab-bar-group-name) tab-bar-group-name))
                 (file-name-nondirectory (directory-file-name project-dir)))))
    (if-let ((tab-bar-group-tabs
              (alist-get (intern tab-bar-group-name) (tab-bar-groups-parse-groups))))
        (tab-bar-select-tab (1+ (tab-bar--tab-index (car tab-bar-group-tabs))))
      (tab-bar-new-tab)
      (tab-bar-groups-store-tab-group tab-bar-group-name)
      (project-switch-project project-dir))))

(defun close-project ()
  "Kill project buffers, close project tabs."
  (interactive)
  (project-kill-buffers)
  (tab-bar-groups-close-group (tab-bar-groups-current-tab)))

(use-package project
  :demand t
  :bind (:map project-prefix-map
              ("p" . switch-project)
              ("k" . close-project)))

;; Add this if you use `tab-bar-echo-area'.
(when (featurep 'tab-bar-echo-area)
  (push #'switch-project tab-bar-echo-area-trigger-display-functions)
  (tab-bar-echo-area-apply-display-tab-names-advice))
#+end_src

* Integration with tab-bar-echo-area

This package provides an integration with the [[https://github.com/fritzgrabo/tab-bar-echo-area][tab-bar-echo-area]] package.

Tabs and tab groups are rendered like in the tab bar (that is,
=tab-bar-format= settings apply here as well).

[[screenshots/tab-bar-groups-tab-bar-echo-area.png]]

After both packages have been loaded, use
=(tab-bar-groups-activate-for-tab-bar-echo-area)= to enable it.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(with-eval-after-load 'tab-bar-echo-area
  (tab-bar-groups-activate-for-tab-bar-echo-area))
#+end_src
